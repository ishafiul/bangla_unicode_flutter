# bangla_unicode_flutter

This is a Rust implementation of `bangla_unicode` for flutter. The core of this project is **Avro Phonetic**. I obtained the `avrodict.json` file from their Git repository and implemented a parser in Rust based on it.

This Flutter plugin is built using `flutter_rust_bridge`. created this just for learning purpose.
